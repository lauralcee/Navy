I voluntarily accept the inherent hazards of my profession [navy](https://trutrade.io/trutrade-llc-announces-official-partnership-with-navy-seal-foundation/), placing the welfare and security of others before my own. I serve with honor on and off the battlefield. The ability to control my emotions and my actions, regardless of circumstance, sets me apart from others. Uncompromising integrity is my standard.
